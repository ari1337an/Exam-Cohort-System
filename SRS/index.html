                                    full unclouded version of the client's requirement about the software, written down
                                    by the business analyst team being as specific as possible in every possible way.
                                    This document covers the entire exam-cohort system's requirements, not just a
                                    subsystem or part of the system. </p>

                                <p>The document's intended audience is Business Clients, System Design Engineers,
                                    Quality Assurance Engineers, Project Managers, and future maintenance-period
                                    team(s). The business analyst can provide the SRS to the client to make sure the
                                    requirements are, in fact, correct; if not, then they can bridge the gap, hence
                                    saving time, cost, and resources. After fully understanding the project's
                                    requirements, the system designer(s) can plan their SDS. The project manager can
                                    grasp all the requirements, plan the project, and choose appropriate development
                                    strategies such as agile, waterfall, or others. Hence, the firm can ship out
                                    high-priority use cases as a priority, eventually saving resources, time, and costs.
                                    The quality assurance team will engineer a test plan according to the requirements
                                    of the SRS document to test that the implemented software meets the client's
                                    requirements. As a fail-safe strategy, this document is intended for
                                    maintenance-period teams who want to understand the software's purpose, scope,
                                    parameters, and goals when the initial project team is away. However, it is
                                    recommended to restrict the access of this document to software developers, as doing
                                    so will help developers rely only on SDS. As a result, system design errors or
                                    inefficiency will be caught in the testing phase by the Quality Assurance team.
                                    Hence, revisions in the system design can be made possible in the next iteration. As
                                    a reading suggestion, following the order of indexes provided in the "Table of
                                    Contents" of the SRS document is recommended.</p>

                                    The "Exam-Cohort" system provides the opportunity to take online exams. The software
                                    system's every user has two roles: evaluator and candidate, in different
                                    circumstances. Users act as evaluators when creating assessments; however, they act
                                    as candidates when appearing for an assessment. One of the primary objectives of the
                                    software is to provide the users with a platform that replaces physical exams.
                                    However, the key business differentiator of this software is the micro-viva feature.
                                    The micro-viva questions are presented to the candidates as a voice recording of the
                                    evaluator. In counterpart, the candidates will answer the micro-viva by recording
                                    their voice, a feature built within the system. The software will maintain security
                                    issues so that the exam system remains as secure as possible while preventing
                                    accidental "answers" leaks. The software complements any learning management system,
                                    educational institute, or modern-day EdTech business; as a result, it can be
                                    incorporated with those businesses or institutes.

                                <p>This product is a part of the software engineering course assessment at North South
                                    University's summer academic semester of 2022. The faculty member proposed the
                                    project idea while acting as a "client" with the student group members who performed
                                    the tasks as an imaginary software firm. The product is a new self-contained system
                                    that is neither a member of a product family nor a replacement of another system.

                                <p>The product must let users log in to the system using their google account, meaning
                                    there will be no separate signup system. Each user, while acting as an evaluator,
                                    must be able to create an exam cohort and add other users as a candidate to this
                                    cohort. Evaluators can add assessments within the cohort; meanwhile, each assessment
                                    is capable of having multiple questions. Users who are added to a cohort as
                                    candidates can appear for assessments. The system will automatically mark the
                                    assessment and generate a spreadsheet with complete breakdowns of each mark of each
                                    assessment for each student. This auto-generated spreadsheet can be accessible by
                                    the evaluator. After the assessment is finished, evaluators can re-evaluate a
                                    candidate's answers to re-adjust the marks. When a candidate takes the assessment,
                                    the system can detect "time limits exceeds" scenarios. As a response, the system can
                                    perform actions such as moving to the next question or auto-submitting the
                                    assessment if it is the last question as a part of security measures.</p>
