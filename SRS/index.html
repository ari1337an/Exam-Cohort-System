                                    by the business analyst team being as specific as possible in every possible way.
                                    This document covers the entire exam-cohort system's requirements, not just a

                                <p>The document's intended audience is Business Clients, System Design Engineers,
                                    Quality Assurance Engineers, Project Managers, and future maintenance-period
                                    team(s). The business analyst can provide the SRS to the client to make sure the
                                    requirements are, in fact, correct; if not, then they can bridge the gap, hence
                                    saving time, cost, and resources. After fully understanding the project's
                                    requirements, the system designer(s) can plan their SDS. The project manager can
                                    grasp all the requirements, plan the project, and choose appropriate development
                                    strategies such as agile, waterfall, or others. Hence, the firm can ship out
                                    high-priority use cases as a priority, eventually saving resources, time, and costs.
                                    The quality assurance team will engineer a test plan according to the requirements
                                    of the SRS document to test that the implemented software meets the client's
                                    requirements. As a fail-safe strategy, this document is intended for
                                    maintenance-period teams who want to understand the software's purpose, scope,
                                    parameters, and goals when the initial project team is away. However, it is
                                    recommended to restrict the access of this document to software developers, as doing
                                    so will help developers rely only on SDS. As a result, system design errors or
                                    inefficiency will be caught in the testing phase by the Quality Assurance team.
                                    Hence, revisions in the system design can be made possible in the next iteration. As
                                    a reading suggestion, following the order of indexes provided in the "Table of
                                    Contents" of the SRS document is recommended.</p>

                                    The "Exam-Cohort" system provides the opportunity to take online exams. The software
                                    system's every user has two roles: evaluator and candidate, in different
                                    circumstances. Users act as evaluators when creating assessments; however, they act
                                    as candidates when appearing for an assessment. One of the primary objectives of the
                                    software is to provide the users with a platform that replaces physical exams.
                                    However, the key business differentiator of this software is the micro-viva feature.
                                    The micro-viva questions are presented to the candidates as a voice recording of the
                                    evaluator. In counterpart, the candidates will answer the micro-viva by recording
                                    their voice, a feature built within the system. The software will maintain security
                                    issues so that the exam system remains as secure as possible while preventing
                                    accidental "answers" leaks. The software complements any learning management system,
                                    educational institute, or modern-day EdTech business; as a result, it can be
                                    incorporated with those businesses or institutes.

                                    University's summer academic semester of 2022. The faculty member proposed the
                                    project idea while acting as a "client" with the student group members who performed
                                    the tasks as an imaginary software firm. The product is a new self-contained system
                                    that is neither a member of a product family nor a replacement of another system.

                                <p>The product must let users log in to the system using their google account, meaning
                                    there will be no separate signup system. Each user, while acting as an evaluator,
                                    must be able to create an exam cohort and add other users as a candidate to this
                                    cohort. Evaluators can add assessments within the cohort; meanwhile, each assessment
                                    is capable of having multiple questions. Users who are added to a cohort as
                                    candidates can appear for assessments. The system will automatically mark the
                                    assessment and generate a spreadsheet with complete breakdowns of each mark of each
                                    assessment for each student. This auto-generated spreadsheet can be accessible by
                                    the evaluator. After the assessment is finished, evaluators can re-evaluate a
                                    candidate's answers to re-adjust the marks. When a candidate takes the assessment,
                                    the system can detect "time limits exceeds" scenarios. As a response, the system can
                                    perform actions such as moving to the next question or auto-submitting the
                                    assessment if it is the last question as a part of security measures.</p>

                                <p>Every user is capable of logging into the system using a google account, meaning

                                    will be no separate signup system. So, when a user logs into the system, they will
                                    be
                                    registered into the system if not so.</p>

                                <p>Each user must be able to create an "Exam-Cohort." The user who creates the
                                    exam-cohort"
                                    is the "Evaluator" of that cohort. And within each exam-cohort, the evaluator can
                                    add
                                    "other users of the system" as a candidate. So, the candidates have to exist in the
                                    system when the evaluator is assigning candidates.</p>

                                <p>Within each exam cohort, the evaluator, besides adding candidates to that cohort, has
                                    the right to create assessment(s). Furthermore, within each assessment, an evaluator
                                    can
                                    add MCQs or Micro-viva questions, re-adjust the marks of a student, and provide the
                                    necessary information for that assessment (i.e., available date-time and
                                    due-date-time).
                                    Within each question, the evaluator must provide the information required for that
                                    question(i.e., marks and time limit).</p>

                                <p>MCQs are the standard multiple-choice-questions, capable of having multiple correct
                                    answers, so the candidate must select all the answers to gain marks in that
                                    question. As
                                    micro-viva questions and answers are entirely in the form of voice recording,
                                    evaluators
                                    and candidates will be entitled to record or listen to the recorded voice within the
                                    user interface provided by the software. When adding micro-via questions or adding
                                    the
                                    correct answer to a micro-viva, the evaluator will record their voice. When sitting
                                    for
                                    an assessment, the candidates can hear the playback of the micro-viva questions and
                                    provide their answers in a recorded voice. When the evaluator wants to re-adjust a
                                    candidate's assessment marks, he can listen to micro-viva answers and view MCQ
                                    answers.</p>

                                <p>The system will automatically mark the assessment and generate a spreadsheet with
                                    complete breakdowns of each mark of each assessment for each student. The evaluator
                                    will

                                    data are relational. However, if the software ever uses any non-relational database
                                    system, it should follow industry standards and best practices: DRY, KISS, and
                                    SOLID.
                                    Also, the client requested that the software's micro-vivas voice recordings need to
                                    be
                                    evaluated using external API solution(s) with correct answers. The software should
                                    have
                                    a language boundary of the English language.</p>

                                <p>For security considerations, the candidates have the right to only appear once for a
                                    particular assessment of an exam-cohort assigned by the evaluator of the cohort.
                                    Candidates cannot access an exam cohort that an evaluator did not assign them. The
                                    same
                                    goes for assessments not part of any exam cohort from the candidate's assigned
                                    cohort
                                    lists. Furthermore, the questions and answer options a candidate sees when appearing
                                    for
                                    an assessment will be randomized and presented in such a manner. There should be no
                                    correct answer leaks from any interfaces interacting with the candidates. A
                                    candidate
                                    can never have the advantage of going past the question's time limit. If the time
                                    exceeds for a question, the system automatically detects that. When the system
                                    detects
                                    such cases, the next question will be presented, withdrawing any access to the
                                    previous
                                    question from the user interface. When time exceeds, and if there is/are no next
                                    question, the system will submit the assessment automatically. A question's time
                                    limit
                                    constraints also extend to the micro-viva type questions, and the candidate must
                                    record
                                    and submit their recorded answers within the time limit.</p>
